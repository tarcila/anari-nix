  # Special case for OPENUSD_PLUGIN_INSTALL_PREFIX...

  # installing in the build folder instead of the output folder.
  # Quoting CMake documentation from https://cmake.org/cmake/help/latest/command/set.html:
  #   Furthermore, if the <type> is PATH or FILEPATH and the <value> provided
  #   on the command line is a relative path, then the set command will treat
  #   the path as relative to the current working directory and convert it to an absolute path.
  # Passing $out to cmakeFlags does not work as $out is escaped but then never evaluated. It then means that
  # installation files go to the litteral $out subfolder of the build tree, as per the above.
  # So, we get that through a custom configurePhase enforcing that value to the cmake flags when $out can be shell evaluated.
